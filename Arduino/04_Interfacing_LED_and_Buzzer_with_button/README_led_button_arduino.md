## 📖 Project Overview

**Purpose**
This project is an introductory embedded systems exercise demonstrating how to read a digital input (a pushbutton) and use that value to drive a digital output (an LED) on an Arduino board.

**Problem Solved**
It's one of the first practical steps beyond "blink an LED" — teaching how to make hardware **respond to user input** in real time using `digitalRead()` and `digitalWrite()`, the foundation of virtually all interactive embedded projects.

**Real-World Applications**
This exact input-to-output pattern scales up to real systems: light switches, safety interlocks, door sensors, appliance controls, and any device where a physical button or sensor needs to trigger an immediate electronic response.

**Target Users**
- Beginners starting out with Arduino and embedded C/C++
- Students in electronics or embedded systems courses
- Hobbyists prototyping simple input-driven circuits on breadboards or TinkerCAD

## ✨ Features

✅ Reads real-time pushbutton state using `digitalRead()`
✅ Drives an LED on/off based on that input using `digitalWrite()`
✅ Minimal, well-commented sketch — easy to read in one pass
✅ Includes circuit diagrams (TinkerCAD simulation + handmade schematic)
✅ Based on Arduino's official public-domain `Button` example

> **Note:** Despite the folder name mentioning a buzzer, the current `Button.ino` sketch only controls an LED — no buzzer logic is present in the code at this time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input** — The pushbutton on pin 2 is read continuously inside `loop()` using `digitalRead(buttonPin)`, which returns `HIGH` when pressed and `LOW` when released.
2. **Processing** — An `if/else` check compares `buttonState` against `HIGH`.
3. **Output** — If the button is pressed, `digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH)` turns the LED on; otherwise `digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW)` keeps it off.
4. **Internal Workflow** — Because this logic runs inside Arduino's continuously repeating `loop()` function, the LED responds to the button in real time with no noticeable delay.

## 🔍 Code Explanation

| Element | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `buttonPin` | `const int` | Stores the digital pin (2) the pushbutton is wired to. |
| `ledPin` | `const int` | Stores the digital pin (13) the LED is wired to — pin 13 also maps to most Arduino boards' built-in LED. |
| `buttonState` | `int` | Holds the current reading (`HIGH`/`LOW`) from the pushbutton each loop cycle. |
| `setup()` | Function | Runs once at startup; configures `ledPin` as `OUTPUT` and `buttonPin` as `INPUT`. |
| `loop()` | Function | Runs continuously; reads the button state and sets the LED on or off accordingly. |

**Circuit (as described in `circuit_diagram.md` and the sketch comments):**
- LED: connected from pin 13 to ground through a 220Ω resistor
- Pushbutton: connected to pin 2 from +5V
- Pull-down resistor: 10KΩ from pin 2 to ground (ensures a defined `LOW` state when the button isn't pressed)

## 💻 Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshukumar146/github.git
cd github/Arduino/04_Interfacing_LED_and_Buzzer_with_button
```

**2. Install the Arduino IDE**
Download from [arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if not already installed.

**3. Open the sketch**
Open `Button.ino` in the Arduino IDE.

## ▶️ Running the Project

**Option A — On real hardware:**
1. Wire the circuit as described above (LED on pin 13 with a 220Ω resistor, pushbutton on pin 2 with a 10KΩ pull-down resistor).
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB.
3. In the Arduino IDE, select your board and port under **Tools**.
4. Click **Upload** to flash `Button.ino` to the board.
5. Press the button — the LED should light up while held down.

**Option B — In simulation (TinkerCAD):**
1. Recreate the circuit in [TinkerCAD Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) (or open the provided diagram as reference).
2. Paste the sketch code into the TinkerCAD code editor.
3. Start the simulation and click the virtual pushbutton to toggle the LED.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- **Press and hold** the pushbutton → LED turns **on**.
- **Release** the pushbutton → LED turns **off**.

No serial input or additional configuration is required — behavior is entirely driven by the physical/simulated button state.

## 📊 Results

The LED on pin 13 mirrors the pushbutton's state in real time:
- Button held down → LED lit
- Button released → LED off

No additional output (serial or otherwise) is produced by the current sketch.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add the buzzer functionality implied by the folder name — e.g., sound a buzzer on pin X whenever the button is pressed alongside the LED
- Debounce the button input in software (using `millis()`-based debouncing) for more reliable readings on real hardware
- Add serial output (`Serial.println()`) to log button state changes for debugging
- Use `INPUT_PULLUP` mode to simplify the circuit by removing the need for an external 10KΩ resistor
- Add a toggle mode (press once to turn LED on, press again to turn it off) instead of hold-to-light behavior
